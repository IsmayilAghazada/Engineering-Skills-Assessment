# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here


In refactoring the original code, I made several changes to improve its readability. 
##
First, I replaced nested if statements with a single if statement and used the logical OR operator to simplify the code. 
##
I also used constants to store repeated values, making it easier to update them if necessary. 
##
Additionally, I removed unnecessary variables and merged some code blocks to reduce the overall complexity of the function. 
##
The refactored version is more concise and easier to read because it eliminates unnecessary code, reduces indentation levels, and uses descriptive constants for clarity.
